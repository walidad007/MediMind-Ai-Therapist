## Key Features
- **Agentic architecture**: planner + tool manager + tool calls (retrieval, checks, etc.).  
- **Streamlit frontend** for simple chat interaction.  
- **FastAPI backend** that runs the agent and returns structured JSON (assistant response + tool used).  
- **Safety-first design**: includes disclaimers and system prompts to reduce harmful or misleading outputs.  

---

## Architecture Overview
- **Frontend (Streamlit)**: Captures user input and posts to the backend (`/ask`), displays chat history.  
- **Backend (FastAPI)**: Accepts requests, wraps user input with system instructions, runs the agent graph, parses streamed output, and returns JSON with `response` and `tool_called`.  
- **Agent module (`ai_agent`)**: orchestrates LLM reasoning (graph), includes `SYSTEM_PROMPT`, and a `parse_response` helper to extract final answer and tools used.
